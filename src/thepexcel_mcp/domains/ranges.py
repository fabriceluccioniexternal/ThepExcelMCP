    Range addressing examples
    -------------------------
    - ``"A1:C10"``            — standard A1 notation (active sheet)
    - ``"Sheet1!A1:C10"``     — sheet-qualified (overrides ``sheet`` param)
    - ``"SalesTable[Amount]"`` — structured table reference

    Actions
    -------
    read
        Read cell values as a 2-D list. Paginated: default 100 rows.
        Returns: ``{values, total_rows, has_more, next_offset}``.
        Cells with strings >500 chars are truncated with ``…`` appended.
        Spill metadata is only computed on the offset-0 page (pagination
        re-pays the same anchor probe for an identical answer on every later
        page, so it's skipped for ``offset > 0``):
        When a cell is the anchor of a spill, the response includes
        ``has_spill: true`` and ``spill_range``.
        When the requested range is a single cell (offset 0) that is part of
        a spill (not the anchor), the response includes ``spill_parent`` with
        the anchor cell address — this check is skipped for multi-cell reads,
        where "part of someone else's spill" isn't a meaningful answer.
        ``value_mode="typed"`` (default) uses ``Range.Value`` so Excel dates
        and currency keep their Python types. ``value_mode="raw"`` uses
        ``Range.Value2`` for faster bulk reads and returns those values as
        Excel serial numbers.
    read_spill
        Given an anchor cell address, returns the full spill range.
        If the cell has no spill (HasSpill is False), returns a clear error.
        Response: ``{anchor, spill_range, values, total_rows, has_more,
        next_offset}``. Paginated via ``offset`` / ``limit``.
    write
        Write a 2-D list of values via ``Range.Value``.
        ``values`` must be a list-of-lists (rows × columns).
        The target range is auto-resized to the data shape, so callers may
        pass just the top-left anchor cell (e.g. ``"A1"``) and the full block
        will be written correctly.
    write_formula
        Write a formula string via ``Range.Formula2`` to the top-left cell.
        Excel spills dynamic array results automatically.
        ``formula`` must start with ``=`` (e.g. ``"=UNIQUE(A1:A100)"``).
    write_py
        Insert a Python-in-Excel formula (``=PY()``) into a single cell via
        ``Range.Formula2R1C1``. Requires ``python_code``.

        **IMPORTANT CAVEATS** (read before use):
        - Execution is asynchronous in Microsoft Azure cloud. The cell shows
          ``#BUSY!`` or ``#CONNECT!`` until Azure processes the formula.
          Requires an M365 subscription with Python in Excel enabled (Preview
          or GA channel as of 2026).
        - This tool CANNOT await results. Use ``excel_range(action="read",
          range="A1")`` in a subsequent call to fetch the computed value.
        - Offline or unsupported accounts: formula shows ``#CONNECT!`` or
          ``#BUSY!`` errors permanently.
        - The ``=PY()`` second argument: ``0`` = return value as Excel type,
          ``1`` = return as Python object (shows custom Python icon in cell).
          This tool always inserts ``0`` (Excel value mode).
        - **Experimental**: the COM insertion path (Formula2R1C1) works in
          testing but Microsoft does not formally document it for automation.
          Treat results as best-effort.
        - Office Scripts: not supported (cloud-only, no COM path) — use
          ``excel_vba`` instead.

        Escaping: any double-quote characters in ``python_code`` are
        automatically doubled for the Excel formula string.

        Example: ``excel_range(action="write_py", range="A1",
        python_code="import pandas as pd\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1,2,3]})")``
    clear
        Clear cell contents (not formatting).
    delete_rows, delete_columns
        Delete entire worksheet rows/columns intersecting the range. Supports
        disjoint areas ("2:4,9:9" or "B:D,G:G") and cell ranges. Overlapping
        intervals are merged and deleted in descending order, preserving the
        original indices. Excel shifts data and adjusts references. Does not
        save the workbook. A failure may leave some intervals already deleted.
