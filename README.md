# ThepExcelMCP

**Give your AI agent hands on the real Excel — not just the file.**

A Windows MCP server that drives a **live, running Excel Desktop** through COM automation.
Power Query that actually refreshes, PivotTables that actually pivot, DAX that actually calculates,
and screenshots so the AI can *see* what it built.

## What is this?

ThepExcelMCP is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that exposes
**26 tools** covering nearly everything a power user can do in Excel — workbooks, ranges, Tables,
Power Query (full M-code CRUD), PivotTables, the Data Model with DAX measures, charts, formatting,
conditional formats, validation, slicers, page setup / PDF export, protection, VBA (opt-in), and a
safety layer with non-destructive snapshots and range/sheet diffing.

It is for anyone who works in **Excel on Windows** and wants an AI agent
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex CLI, or any MCP client) to do real spreadsheet work:
analysts automating monthly reporting, Excel pros building Power Query pipelines by prompt,
and developers who need an agent to build *and verify* real workbooks.

When an agent calls a tool here, it is talking to the actual Excel process — **including the
workbook you already have open**. This is the difference between editing an XML zip file and
actually using Excel.

## Quick start — hand it to your AI agent

Send this GitHub link to your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex CLI, …) and tell it to take
over — it will read this README and set the MCP server up for you, as either **user scope**
(every project) or **project scope** (one project only). ❤️

> 🇹🇭 แค่ส่งลิงก์ GitHub นี้ให้ AI Agent ของคุณ แล้วบอกให้ AI จัดการต่อได้เลย จะลง MCP เป็น User Scope หรือ Project Scope ก็ได้ ❤️

```
https://github.com/ThepExcel/ThepExcelMCP
```

Once registered, just talk to your agent. Things you can say:

- *"Read the table on Sheet1 of Book1 and build a PivotTable of sales by Region, with a chart."*
- *"Write a Power Query that loads `products.csv` and `orders.xlsx`, merges them on ProductID, and loads the result into a Table."*
- *"Add a DAX measure `Total Revenue = SUM(Orders[Amount])` to the Data Model and format it as currency."*
- *"Format the report header on the Summary sheet — bold, fill `#4472C4`, white text, freeze the top row — then screenshot it so you can check it looks right."*
- *"Take a snapshot of this workbook first, then replace every occurrence of 'Widget' with 'Gadget' across the whole workbook and show me a diff."*

## Why a live Excel, not a file library?

File-based libraries (`openpyxl`, xlsx skills, raw XML editing) read and write the `.xlsx` on
disk — but they cannot *operate Excel*. Driving the real application means the agent can author
a complete solution from a blank workbook, on live data, with Excel doing the computing:

| Capability | File libraries (openpyxl etc.) | ThepExcelMCP (live COM) |
|---|---|---|
| Read/write cells & formulas | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Evaluate formulas / dynamic arrays** (`XLOOKUP`, `FILTER`, spill) | ❌ stale cached values | ✅ live calc engine, spill read-back |
| **Power Query** — create/edit M code, refresh against sources | ❌ | ✅ full CRUD + refresh + parameters |
| **PivotTables** with real aggregation | ❌ (often destroyed on save) | ✅ create, field ops, layout, read |
| **Data Model / Power Pivot** — relationships, DAX measures | ❌ | ✅ + CUBEVALUE/CUBEMEMBER helpers |
| **Charts** incl. true PivotCharts | ⚠️ limited, fragile | ✅ create/configure + PNG export |
| **Visual verification** — screenshot what was built | ❌ | ✅ range / sheet / chart → PNG |
| Work on the **workbook you already have open** | ❌ file must be closed | ✅ attaches to the running instance |
| VBA macros, PDF export, slicers, threaded comments | ❌ | ✅ |

Every call runs through a single STA COM worker thread, so Excel's own rules for calculation,
formatting, and events apply exactly as they would for a human at the keyboard. And because the
agent can **screenshot** any range, sheet, or chart, it can close the loop: build → look → fix.

## How it runs — local, not a hosted service

ThepExcelMCP is a **stdio MCP server that runs as a process on your own Windows machine** and
controls the Excel running there. Nothing to sign up for, no account, and no spreadsheet data
leaves your computer.

- ✅ **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, and **Codex CLI** run locally and can launch it.
- ❌ Cloud-only agent surfaces that can't run a local process on your machine can't reach your
  local Excel, so they can't use it.

## The 26 tools

Grouped by capability — every tool is action-dispatched (`action="..."`), with precise,
example-rich docstrings that serve as the LLM-facing API.

| Area | Tools | What the agent can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Workbooks, sheets & data I/O** | `excel_workbook` · `excel_sheet` · `excel_range` · `excel_table` | Open/create/save workbooks, manage sheets, read/write ranges (paginated, spill-aware, typed or faster raw `Value2` reads, `Formula2` dynamic arrays, experimental `=PY()`), full Excel Table (ListObject) lifecycle including bulk append, sort, filter, styles, totals, and structured references |
| **Power Query & Data Model** | `excel_powerquery` · `excel_datamodel` · `excel_name` | Create/edit/refresh M queries with a built-in M static analyzer, query parameters, load to Table or Data Model; model tables, relationships, DAX measures; CUBE formula helpers; named ranges & LAMBDA functions |
| **PivotTables** | `excel_pivot` · `excel_slicer` | Create pivots from a range, Table, or the Data Model; add/move/remove fields with real aggregations; layouts & subtotals; slicers and date timelines |

Structured references work naturally: `excel_range(action="read", range="Orders[Amount]")`.

Delete whole worksheet rows or columns in an open workbook:

```python
excel_range(action="delete_rows", range="2:4,9:9", sheet="Data", workbook="Test.xlsx")
excel_range(action="delete_columns", range="B:D,G:G", sheet="Data", workbook="Test.xlsx")
```

Cell ranges also work: deleting rows for `A2:B4,C9` removes all of rows 2-4
and 9, including cells outside the selected columns. Overlapping intervals are
merged, then removed from highest index to lowest so disjoint selections retain
their original indices. Excel shifts cells and adjusts references. The response
reports the workbook, sheet, axis, original intervals and deleted count under
`deleted`. The workbook is not saved. Multi-block deletion is not atomic: an
error reports any intervals already removed.

</details>

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 / 11**
- **Microsoft 365 Excel Desktop** — auto-launched with a blank workbook if not already running
  (opt out with `THEPEXCEL_MCP_AUTOLAUNCH=0`)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — installs and manages the right Python for you, so you do
  **not** need to install Python separately:

  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```

  Or via winget: `winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e`. Close and reopen your terminal afterward.

## Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ThepExcel/ThepExcelMCP.git
cd ThepExcelMCP
uv sync
```

`uv sync` installs `fastmcp`, `pywin32`, and `pillow` into an isolated virtual environment.
No pip or manual virtualenv setup required.

### Register with Claude Code (CLI)

```powershell
claude mcp add thepexcel-excel --scope user -- uv run --directory C:\path\to\ThepExcelMCP python -m thepexcel_mcp.server
```

Substitute `C:\path\to\ThepExcelMCP` with your own clone path. Verify with `claude mcp list`.

To enable VBA as well:

```powershell
claude mcp add thepexcel-excel --scope user `
  -e THEPEXCEL_MCP_ENABLE_VBA=1 `
  -- uv run --directory C:\path\to\ThepExcelMCP python -m thepexcel_mcp.server
```

### Register with Claude Desktop

**Option A — MCPB bundle (one file, drag-and-drop). Recommended for Claude Desktop, and it is
the path that reaches the Cowork tab too.**

1. Get the bundle. **Download `thepexcel-mcp.mcpb` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/ThepExcel/ThepExcelMCP/releases/latest)** — no clone, no
   build. (You still need `uv` on this machine — the bundle launches the server through `uv run`,
   it does not vendor Python.) To build it yourself from a clone instead:

   ```powershell
   uv run python scripts/build_mcpb.py
   ```

   This produces `dist/thepexcel-mcp.mcpb` (~225 KB: `manifest.json`, `pyproject.toml`,
   `uv.lock`, `src/`).

2. In Claude Desktop open **Settings → Desktop app → Extensions**, then either drag
   `thepexcel-mcp.mcpb` onto the *"Drag .MCPB or .DXT files here to install"* area or use
   **Advanced settings → Install extension** and pick the file. The preview shows the manifest;
   click **Install**.

3. **Configure** (button next to *ThepExcel Excel MCP* under *Installed on your computer*):
   *Auto-launch Excel* (default on) and *Enable VBA tool* (default off — needs the VBA project
   object model trust setting in Excel). These map to `THEPEXCEL_MCP_AUTOLAUNCH` /
   `THEPEXCEL_MCP_ENABLE_VBA`.

4. Start a new chat. The `excel_*` tools appear in the tool list; the first call launches Excel on
   your machine.

Verified 2026-08-16 on Windows 11 / Claude Desktop with the Cowork tab: install succeeds and the
extension shows under *Installed on your computer*.

> **"Failed to preview extension: Invalid manifest: server: Required; user_config: Required"** —
> you have a bundle built before 2026-08-16. Older `manifest.json` used `server.type: "uv"`, which
> the current MCPB schema does not accept (allowed: `python` / `node` / `binary` plus an explicit
> `mcp_config`). Pull, rebuild with `scripts/build_mcpb.py`, and install the new file. You can
> check any bundle's manifest with `npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb validate manifest.json`.

**Option B — manual config.** Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thepexcel-excel": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "C:\\path\\to\\ThepExcelMCP", "python", "-m", "thepexcel_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

<details>
<summary><strong>Register with Codex CLI</strong></summary>

Codex talks MCP over the same stdio transport. `codex mcp add` writes to your **user-scoped**
config (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```powershell
codex mcp add thepexcel-excel -- uv run --directory C:\path\to\ThepExcelMCP python -m thepexcel_mcp.server
```

Verify: `codex mcp list` / `codex mcp get thepexcel-excel`. Equivalent manual edit:

```toml
[mcp_servers.thepexcel-excel]
command = "uv"
args = ["run", "--directory", "C:\\path\\to\\ThepExcelMCP", "python", "-m", "thepexcel_mcp.server"]
```

**Project-scoped:** add the same block to `.codex/config.toml` in the project root (there is no
CLI flag for project scope). Codex must trust the project, and project-scoped servers currently
load on the CLI only — Codex Desktop reads just the user config
([openai/codex#13025](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/13025)). Restart the Codex session
after editing — MCP tools load at session start.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Using from WSL</strong></summary>

The server itself **cannot run inside WSL** (no `pywin32`, no COM). But if your MCP client runs
inside WSL, register the server so the *command* is the Windows `uv.exe` pointing at a **Windows**
checkout:

```bash
claude mcp add thepexcel-excel --scope user -- \
  uv.exe run --directory 'C:\Tools\ThepExcelMCP' python -m thepexcel_mcp.server
```

The stdio pipes bridge the WSL→Windows boundary; the server and Excel both run natively on
Windows. Excel must be open in your Windows desktop session. This path runs the same code on
Windows under the hood — offered as guidance, not a separately tested install mode.

</details>

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `THEPEXCEL_MCP_AUTOLAUNCH` | `1` (on) | Auto-launch a visible Excel (+ blank workbook) if none is running. Set `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to require Excel be opened manually. |
| `THEPEXCEL_MCP_ENABLE_VBA` | unset (off) | Set `1` to enable the `excel_vba` tool. Off by default for security. |
| `THEPEXCEL_MCP_COM_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Per-call COM timeout in seconds. Increase for slow data refreshes. |
| `THEPEXCEL_MCP_EARLYBIND` | `1` (on) — perf default | Early-bind the already-attached Excel COM Application. Corrected wrapper-forced benchmarks showed modest gains (9% faster property reads in the latest run). Set `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to force a truly dynamic wrapper. |
| `THEPEXCEL_MCP_TOOL_DISCOVERY` | `full` | Set `bm25` to expose only orientation/read tools plus `search_tools`/`call_tool`; the full 26-tool API remains callable and the initial catalog is about 94% smaller. |

## Platform support

This server drives a real Excel process through Windows COM (`pywin32`), so it is
**Windows-only by design**:

- ✅ **Windows 10 / 11** — fully supported.
- ❌ **macOS** — Excel for Mac has no COM automation API and `pywin32` does not exist there.
  Hard platform limitation, not a missing feature.
- ⚠️ **WSL** — supported via the cross-boundary setup above (server runs as a native Windows process).

## Safety model

Letting an AI agent drive your real Excel deserves guardrails. They are built in:

- **Snapshots are non-destructive by construction.** `excel_snapshot` uses `SaveCopyAs` — it
  streams a copy to disk **without** touching the live workbook's saved-state, name, or path.
  `restore` opens the copy as a **separate new workbook** alongside your original; it never
  closes, overwrites, or reverts the workbook you are editing. There is deliberately no
  in-place-revert code path. Encourage your agent to snapshot before risky bulk operations.
- **Audit what changed.** `excel_diff` compares two ranges or whole sheets cell-by-cell (values,
  formulas, or both) as a pure read — perfect for before/after verification.
- **VBA is double-gated.** The `excel_vba` tool requires **both** the
  `THEPEXCEL_MCP_ENABLE_VBA=1` environment variable **and** Excel's own trust setting
  (*File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings → Macro Settings → "Trust access to
  the VBA project object model"*). Without both, calls return a clear error naming the missing gate.
- **Verified effects, not just success codes.** Mutating tools read back the actual cell /
  format / file state after acting; COM errors surface as actionable `ToolError` messages.
- **Local only.** stdio transport, your machine, your Excel. No network service, no telemetry.

### Known limitations

- **Data Model load can deadlock in headless stdio contexts.** `excel_datamodel(add_table)` and
  `excel_powerquery(load_to_datamodel)` trigger a Mashup refresh that needs Excel's UI message
  pump; in a CLI stdio session this can deadlock the COM worker until Excel is force-killed
  (it works with a fully visible Excel window, e.g. under Claude Desktop). **Fallback that is
  verified end-to-end:** `load_to_table` → `excel_pivot(create, source="<table>")` — the full
  cross-file Power Query merge → Table → PivotTable → PivotChart → slicer flow works this way.
- **Screenshots need a visible Excel window.** `excel_screenshot` and `excel_chart(export_image)`
  use `CopyPicture`, which requires the window to render on screen — a minimized/hidden Excel can
  yield empty PNGs.
- **LAMBDA parameter names** must not look like cell references (`q1`, `x2`) — use `val`, `rate`,
  `n`. A failed LAMBDA add can leave hidden `_xlpm.*` names that block later adds; use a fresh
  workbook if that happens.
- **`=PY()` (Python in Excel)** is inserted but executed asynchronously by Microsoft's cloud
  service — requires an M365 subscription with Python in Excel; the tool does not wait for the
  cloud result.
- **VBA `run`** returns scalars (Long/String/Double) from Functions; Subs return None; arrays and
  objects are not supported.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Server won't start; Windows says an Application Control policy blocked `thepexcel-mcp.exe` | Smart App Control / WDAC blocks the unsigned launcher shim `uv` writes into `.venv\Scripts`. The commands in this README launch `python -m thepexcel_mcp.server` instead, which runs the same code without that shim — re-register with the current command if yours still ends in `thepexcel-mcp`. |
| "Excel is not running" but you didn't start it | You don't have to — auto-launch is **on by default** (visible Excel + blank workbook). If you set `THEPEXCEL_MCP_AUTOLAUNCH=0`, open Excel yourself first. |
| `AttributeError: ... CLSIDToClassMap` masquerading as "Excel not running" | Corrupt win32com `gen_py` early-binding cache. The server **self-heals** this: it clears the cache and retries once, automatically. |
| Workbook open in a *second* Excel instance not found | Handled: the server scans the Windows Running Object Table (ROT) as a fallback when a workbook isn't in the first Excel instance. |
| You edited the server code but behavior didn't change | The registered stdio server keeps old code in memory — an editable install is **not** hot reload. Restart the MCP server (e.g. start a fresh client session). |
| Slow Power Query refresh times out | Raise `THEPEXCEL_MCP_COM_TIMEOUT` (seconds; default 120). |
| All tool calls hang after a Data-Model load | The known deadlock above — force-close Excel, restart the server, and use the `load_to_table` fallback. |
| Empty screenshot PNGs | Keep the Excel window visible (not minimized) during `excel_screenshot` / `export_image`. |

## Using the bundled skill

The repo ships a Claude skill at [`skills/excel-god/`](skills/excel-god/) — a strategy and
orchestration guide that helps an agent decide which tools to call, in what order, for common
jobs (dashboards, Power Query data cleaning, Data Model setup, …).

```bash
# project-level
cp -r skills/excel-god /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/

# user-level (available in all projects)
cp -r skills/excel-god ~/.claude/skills/
```

Then invoke it with `/excel-god` in a Claude Code session.

## Development

```powershell
uv sync --frozen                                              # install exactly the locked dependencies
uv run pytest -q                                              # 1000+ unit tests — mocked COM, no Excel needed
uv run ruff check src scripts --select E9,F                  # syntax/import/static checks
uv run python tests/smoke_com.py                              # live COM smoke suite (Windows + Excel)
uv run python tests/smoke_com.py --sections 1,2,3,4           # subset (sections 1–29)
uv run --isolated --with mcp==2.0.0 python tests/protocol_smoke_v2.py  # real stdio handshake
uv run python scripts/build_mcpb.py                           # build dist/thepexcel-mcp.mcpb
```

The live smoke suite performs real read-back verification against a running Excel (it launches
its own instance) and takes roughly 5–10 minutes for all 29 sections.

Project layout, in brief:

```
src/thepexcel_mcp/
├── server.py          # FastMCP app — 26 tool registrations; docstrings are the LLM-facing API
├── session.py         # ExcelSession — STA COM worker thread, run_com(), ROT fallback, guards
├── domains/           # one module per tool (workbook, ranges, powerquery, pivots, datamodel, …)
└── analysis/          # M-code static analyzer used by excel_powerquery
tests/                 # 1000+ unit tests (mocked COM) + protocol/live Excel smoke suites
skills/excel-god/      # bundled agent skill
scripts/build_mcpb.py  # MCPB bundle builder for Claude Desktop
```

Architecture in one line: every tool handler submits its COM callable to a single dedicated
**STA worker thread** (`run_com()`), which owns the COM apartment — serialized, timeout-guarded,
with `DisplayAlerts` suppressed around risky operations.
